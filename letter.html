        <p>Dear Papa,<br/>
        What a shame I can't be there with you today to celebrate your 60th but let's be honest.. I'm sure you prefer the peace! <br/>
        As I couldn't make it to spend the day with you, nor did I trust the post to get you a letter on time or even at all, I decided to send you it virtually. A birthday card and gift
        in the form of a website.<br/>
        Thank you for being a great dad, for supporting us, putting us straight every once in a while and for loving us, more or less unconditionally but completely! Thank you for our upbringing, our education and all the experiences you allowed us to have growing up. I love you very
        much and am looking forward to the end of this isolation so that we can seriously celebrate! <br/>
        I put a few photos together for you, so take a look at the Photo Gallery page and hopefully there will be something for you to physically open as well. I wanted to buy you a
        motorbike helmet for your upcoming trip, but of course.. you've already keenly got one! In the meantime, I hope the thought counts.<br/>
        Lots and lots and lots of love...<br/>
